## Introduction

The Taylor series is a powerful mathematical concept that allows for the approximation of functions using polynomials. In this repository, we explore the Taylor series in the context of machine learning, especially focusing on its application in creating efficient models for various tasks in NLP and data science.

The repository includes implementations using popular frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, covering various neural network architectures such as LSTM networks and seq2seq models. Additionally, we integrate BERT embeddings to enhance the performance of language tasks. 

## Topics Covered

This repository focuses on a range of topics that are essential for understanding and applying the Taylor series in machine learning. Key topics include:

- **BERT Embeddings**: Using BERT for natural language understanding.
- **BERT Model**: Implementation and fine-tuning of BERT models.
- **Data Science**: Data handling and preprocessing techniques.
- **Deep Learning**: Foundations and advanced topics in deep learning.
- **LSTM Neural Networks**: Implementation of LSTM networks for sequence prediction.
- **NLP**: Techniques and algorithms in natural language processing.
- **Polynomials**: Understanding polynomial functions and their approximations.
- **Python 3**: The primary language for implementations in this repository.
- **Seq2Seq**: Sequence-to-sequence models for tasks such as translation.
- **Symbolic AI**: Exploring the intersection of symbolic reasoning and neural networks.

## Installation

To get started with the Taylor Series repository, you need to clone it to your local machine. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bezehard/taylor_series.git
cd taylor_series
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

After setting up the repository, you can run various scripts provided. Each script demonstrates different functionalities related to the Taylor series and its applications.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the repository:

```python
from taylor_series import TaylorApproximation

# Create a Taylor series approximation of a function
approx = TaylorApproximation(func='sin', order=5)
result = approx.compute(x=0.5)

print(f'Taylor Series Approximation: {result}')
```

## Examples

We provide several examples to showcase how to use the implementations effectively. Here are a few:

### 1. Taylor Series Approximation of Sine Function

This example demonstrates how to compute the Taylor series approximation of the sine function.

```python
from taylor_series import TaylorApproximation

approx = TaylorApproximation(func='sin', order=10)
for x in range(-10, 11):
    print(f'sin({x}) â‰ˆ {approx.compute(x)}')
```

### 2. BERT Embeddings for Text Classification

This example shows how to use BERT embeddings for a simple text classification task.

```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertModel
import torch

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

inputs = tokenizer("Hello, this is a test.", return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model(**inputs)

print(outputs)
```

### 3. LSTM for Sequence Prediction

This example demonstrates how to build an LSTM network to predict the next value in a sequence.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class LSTMModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_layers):
        super(LSTMModel, self).__init__()
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        out, _ = self.lstm(x)
        return self.fc(out[:, -1, :])

model = LSTMModel(input_size=1, hidden_size=64, num_layers=2)
```
